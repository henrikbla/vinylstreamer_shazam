This is a personal hobby project, built to solve the need to identify the song currently playing in a self-hosted webradio.

Prerequisites:

* A suitable service to capture audio (I am using Darkice, but others may work as well)
* Icecast server for streaming the media

The setup should work with any kind of media player that is able to connect to an arbitrary stream. I am using Sonos and Home Assistant.
